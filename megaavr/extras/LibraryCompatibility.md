# Library Compatibility
Please include information that uniquely identifies the library, as popular libraries have dozens of forks all over the internet, and it is often difficult to identify which is the "right one". Bonus points if you include a version number too - but I've given up on that!

## DxCore vs megaTinyCore
This page is linked to from the DxCore documentation as well, for the simple reason that the similarity of the underlying hardware is such that something that works with one will work with the other unless it's using specific features that are only present on one of the two (that is, it is a library for making use of a specific peripheral which was changed between those processors, which will always require library adjustment). It also, among other things, means that it is a recently written library with an author to complain to), or if it is very poorly written and checks for specific parts, rather than peripeheral types or things that are true for a whole host of parts (ie, testing for `#if defined(__ATtint3216__) || defined(__ATtiny1614__)` - the two things the author tested on - when the exact same code might work on any modern AVR if they had instead tested `#if (__AVR_ARCH__>=102 && AVR_ARCH <= 104)` - which picks up all modern AVRs with 64k of flash (102), 128k of flash (104) or 48k-or=less of flash (103 - the condition of `__AVR_ARCH==103` is notable in that the flash is fully memory-mapped in these parts, and is not fully mapped for other Arduino-compatible AVRs).

## Pre-compiled libraries
As of megaTinyCore 2.4.0, pre-compiled libraries (ie, those distributed with an archive file for each supported part) can be used. These sort of libraries have several significanrt disadvantages. First and foremost. the library must include a compiled .a file for the specific part being used. The libraries are also typically distributed without source code, so you cannot generate those files for the device you want to use. This is also the primary motivation for use of such libraries - to allow authors to distribute a library without letting anyone see their code, which may be licensed under proprietary terms. The libraries also trade off compile speed for binary size - but in the wrong direction: Compile speed increases because the library doesn't need to be compiled, but lacking the symbols normally left for the link-time optimizer, the linker cannot make it as small as it could if compiling from source. Finally, because the code is not available, you must rely upon the documentation provided by the library creators; and the commercial entities who adore proprietary licenses are far from immune to bad documentation. For these reasons, although they are supported, they are not recommended where alternatives are available.
